# Using babel-plugin-react-native-nodeify-hack Package

If you're working with React Native and need to use node.js libraries that expect `Buffer` and `process` in the global namespace, the `babel-plugin-react-native-nodeify-hack` package can help you inject them.

## Get Started

1. Install the required packages:
```
yarn add buffer process babel-plugin-react-native-nodeify-hack
```

2. Update your `.babelrc` file to include the plugin:
```json
{
  "presets": ["react-native"],
  "plugins": ["babel-plugin-react-native-nodeify-hack"]
}
```

3. Manually import `buffer` and `process` modules in your entry files:
```javascript
import process from 'process';
import buffer from 'buffer';
```

4. You are now ready to use node.js libraries in your React Native project!

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, try deleting cache files and restarting the React Native Packager:
```
rm -rf $TMPDIR/react-*
react-native start
```

## Contributing

If you encounter bugs or issues, feel free to contribute by sending Pull Requests to the project repository.

Happy coding with node.js libraries in React Native!
